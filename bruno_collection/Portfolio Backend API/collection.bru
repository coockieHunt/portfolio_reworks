  # 🚀 Portfolio Backend API - Documentation
  
  This collection contains all the necessary requests to interact with the Portfolio API. It is organized by domain and includes both functional tests and security/validation tests.
  
  ## 🛠 Setup & Environment
  
  Before running any requests, ensure you have configured your environment:
  
  > **Note:** Routes marked with 🔒 are secured. You must log in before accessing them.
  
  1. **Active Environment**: Select the `Local` or `Production` environment in the top right corner.
  2. **Variables**:
    - `base_url`: The root URL of your API (e.g., `http://localhost:3001/api`).
    - `admin_password`: The passkey for the Guestbook easter egg (intentionally hardcoded/public).
  
  ## 📂 Structure
  
  - **📝 Blog**: Manage articles (Fetch, Delete, Cache management).
  - **📖 Guestbook**: Handle user messages (Easter egg feature).
  - **✉️ Mail Service**: Send contact emails using the backend.
  - **📊 Counter**: Analytics powered by Redis.
  - **🚀 System**: Health checks and API status.
  - **🔒 Auth**: Authentication system (JWT token).
  
  ## ❌ Validation Policy
  
  Folders or requests marked with a **❌** are dedicated to **Validation & Error Testing**. 
  They ensure that the API correctly handles:
  - Wrong passwords (401 Unauthorized)
  - Oversized messages (400 Bad Request)
  - Empty or malformed data
  - Invalid database keys
